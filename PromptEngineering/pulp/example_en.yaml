    constraints:
      The total cost must not exceed the weekly advertising budget of $30,000:

        The_number_of_ads_at_bus_stops <= 20
      The_number_of_ads_in_theatres must not exceed one-third of the total number of advertisements:
        The_number_of_ads_in_theatres <= 1/3 \times (The_number_of_ads_at_bus_stops+The_number_of_ads_in_theatres+The_number_of_ads_in_malls)
      At least 20% of the ads should be placed in malls:
