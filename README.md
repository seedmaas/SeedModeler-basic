# README for Automatic Modeling - ICML 2024 AutoMath Challenge Submission

Welcome to the official code repository for our submission to the ICML 2024 Challenges on Automated Math Reasoning, specifically for Track 3: Automated Optimization Problem-Solving with Code.

## Overview

This repository contains the Python code and associated documentation necessary to understand and replicate our successful approach to the competition's challenges. Our solution leverages advanced algorithms and mathematical frameworks to automatically generate and solve optimization problems, pushing the boundaries of automated mathematical reasoning.

## Competition Background

## Getting Started

### Configuring OS Environment Variables

Our code requires specific OS environment variables to be set to function correctly. 

### Running the Code

Once you have configured the required environment variables, you can run the main script to replicate our model's performance or apply it to new optimization problems:

```bash
python ICML_test_no_optimal.py
```

Please note, the `ICML_test_no_optimal.py` script includes comprehensive comments and instructions on usage and customization options.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - This file, containing an overview and setup instructions.
- `ICML_test_no_optimal.py` - The primary script for executing our model.
- `utils/` `agent/`- Contains Python scripts defining the optimization workflow used.
- `PromptEngineering/` - Directory for storing input prompt.
